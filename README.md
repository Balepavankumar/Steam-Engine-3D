This repository contains the complete 3D CAD design files of a classic reciprocating steam engine, including:
Piston-cylinder assembly
Crankshaft and flywheel
Valve gear
Base frame and supports
This project is a detailed 3D CAD model of a working **Steam Engine**, designed using **SolidWorks 2024**. It showcases key mechanical components and mechanisms involved in converting steam energy into mechanical motion.
The purpose of this project is to model and simulate the working of a basic steam engine, focusing on:
- Realistic mechanical movement
- Assembly of parts using proper mates
- Visualization through exploded views and animations
- Technical documentation with drawings
Key components
-Cylinder
-cylinder Head
-piston
-crank shaft
-Connecting rod
-flywheel
-base
-Piston rods
Etc.,
How to use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `.SLDASM` files using **SolidWorks 2024**.
3. Explore part files and modify dimensions if needed.
4. Run the **Motion Study** to visualize movement.
5. View or export technical drawings from the `Drawings/folder.
